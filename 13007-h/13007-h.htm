<p id="d0e87">Some explanation is needed of the form of spelling I have adopted in transcribing Norse proper names. The spirants <i>&thorn;</i> and <i>&eth;</i> are represented by <i>th</i> and <i>d</i>, as being more familiar to readers unacquainted with the  original. Marks of vowel-length are in all cases omitted. The inflexional
<i>-r</i> of the nominative singular masculine is also omitted, whether it appears as <i>-r</i> or is assimilated to a preceding consonant (as in Odinn, Eysteinn, Heindall, Egill) in the Norse form, with the single exception
of the name Tyr, where I use the form which has become conventional in English.

</p><span class="pageno"><a id="d0e117"></a>Page 1</span><a id="d0e119"></a><h1>The Divine Mythology of the North</h1>
<p id="d0e122">The Icelandic Eddas are the only vernacular record of Germanic heathendom as it developed during the four centuries which
in England saw the destruction of nearly all traces of the heathen system. The so-called Elder Edda is a collection of some
thirty poems, mythic and heroic in substance, interspersed with short pieces of prose, which survives in a thirteenth-century
MS., known as the Codex Regius, discovered in Iceland in 1642; to these are added other poems of similar character from other
sources. The Younger Edda is a prose paraphrase of, and commentary on, these poems and others which are lost, together with
a treatise on metre, written by the historian Snorri Sturluson about 1220.

</p>
<p id="d0e124">This use of the word Edda is incorrect and unhistorical, though convenient and sanctioned by the use of several centuries.
It was early used as a general term for the rules and materials for versemaking, and applied in this sense to Snorri's <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e126"></a>Page 2</span>work. When the poems on which his paraphrase is founded were discovered, Icelandic scholars by a misunderstanding applied
the name to them also; and as they attributed the collection quite arbitrarily to the historian Saemund (1056&#8211;1133), it was
long known as Saemundar Edda, a name now generally discarded in favour of the less misleading titles of Elder or Poetic Edda.
From its application to this collection, the word derives a more extended use, (1) as a general term for Norse mythology;
(2) as a convenient name to distinguish the simpler style of these anonymous narrative poems from the elaborate formality
of the Skalds.

</p>
<p id="d0e128">The poems of the Edda are certainly older than the MS., although the old opinion as to their high antiquity is untenable.
The majority probably date from the tenth century in their present form; this dating does not necessitate the ascription of
the shape in which the legends are presented, still less of their substance, to that period. With regard to the place of their
composition opinions vary widely, Norway, the British Isles and Greenland having all found champions; but the evidence is
rather questionable, and I incline to leave them to the country which has preserved them. They are possibly of popular origin;
this, together with their epic or narrative character, would account for the striking absence from them of some of the chief
characteristics of Skaldic poetry: the obscuring of <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e130"></a>Page 3</span>the sense by the elaborate interlacing of sentences and the extensive use of kennings or mythological synonyms, and the complication
of the metre by such expedients as the conjunction of end-rhyme with alliteration. Eddie verse is governed solely by the latter,
and the strophic arrangement is simple, only two forms occurring: (1) couplets of alliterative short lines; (2) six-line strophes,
consisting of a couplet followed by a single short line, the whole repeated.

</p>
<p id="d0e132">Roughly speaking, the first two-fifths of the MS. is mythological, the rest heroic. I propose to observe this distinction,
and to deal in this study with the stories of the Gods. In this connexion, Snorri's Edda and the mythical Ynglinga Saga may
also be considered, but as both were compiled a couple of centuries or more after the introduction of Christianity into Iceland,
it is uncertain how much in them is literary explanation of tradition whose meaning was forgotten; some also, especially in
Snorri, is probably pure invention, fairy tale rather than myth.

</p>
<p id="d0e134">Many attempts have been made to prove that the material of the Edda is largely borrowed. The strength and distinction of Icelandic
poetry rest rather on the fact that it is original and national and, like that of Greece, owes little to foreign sources;
and that it began in the heathen age, before Christian or Romantic influences had touched Iceland. Valuable as the early Christian
poetry <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e136"></a>Page 4</span>of England is, we look in vain there for the humour, the large-minded simplicity of motive, the suggestive character-drawing,
the swift dramatic action, which are as conspicuous in many poems in the Edda as in many of the Sagas.

</p>
<p id="d0e138">Omitting the heroic poems, there are in Codex Regius the following: (1) Of a more or less comprehensive character, <i>V&ouml;luspa, Vafthrudnismal, Grimnismal, Lokasenna, Harbardsljod</i>; (2) dealing with episodes, <i>Hymiskvida, Thrymskvida, Skirnisf&ouml;r. Havamal</i> is a collection of proverbs, but contains two interpolations from mythical poems; <i>Alvissmal</i>, which, in the form of a dialogue between Thor and a dwarf Alviss, gives a list of synonyms, is a kind of mythologico-poetical
glossary. Several of these poems are found in another thirteenth-century vellum fragment, with an additional one, variously
styled <i>Vegtamskvida</i> or <i>Baldr's Dreams</i>; the great fourteenth-century codex Flateybook contains <i>Hyndluljod</i>, partly genealogical, partly an imitation of <i>V&ouml;luspa</i>; and one of the MSS. of Snorri's Edda gives us <i>Rigsthula</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e164"><i>V&ouml;luspa</i>, though not one of the earliest poems, forms an appropriate opening. Metrical considerations forbid an earlier date than
the first quarter of the eleventh century, and the last few lines are still later. The material is, however, older: the poem
is an outline, in allusions often obscure to us, of traditions and beliefs familiar to its first hearers. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e168"></a>Page 5</span>The very bareness of the outline is sufficient proof that the material is not new. The framework is apparently imitated from
that of the poem known as <i>Baldr's Dreams</i>, some lines from which are inserted in <i>V&ouml;luspa</i>. This older poem describes Odin's visit to the Sibyl in hell-gates to inquire into the future. He rides down to her tomb
at the eastern door of Nifl-hell and chants spells, until she awakes and asks: &#8220;What man unknown to me is that, who has troubled
me with this weary journey? Snow has snowed on me, rain has beaten me, dew has drenched me, I have long been dead.&#8221; He gives
the name Wegtam, or Way-wise, and then follow question and answer until she discovers his identity and will say no more. In
<i>V&ouml;luspa</i> there is no descriptive introduction, and no dialogue; the whole is spoken by the Sibyl, who plunges at once into her story,
with only the explanatory words: &#8220;Thou, Valfather, wouldst have me tell the ancient histories of men as far as I remember.&#8221;
She describes the creation of the world and sky by Bor's sons; the building by the Gods of a citadel in Ida-plain, and their
age of innocence till three giant-maids brought greed of gold; the creation of the dwarfs; the creation of the first man and
woman out of two trees by Odin, Hoeni and Lodur; the world-ash and the spring beside it where dwell the three Norns who order
the fates of men. Then follows an allusion to the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e179"></a>Page 6</span>war between the Aesir and the Vanir, the battle with the giants who had got possession of the goddess Freyja, and the breaking
of bargains; an obscure reference to Mimi's spring where Odin left his eye as a pledge; and an enumeration of his war-maids
or Valkyries. Turning to the future, the Sibyl prophesies the death of Baldr, the vengeance on his slayer, and the chaining
of Loki, the doom of the Gods and the destruction of the world at the coming of the fire-giants and the release of Loki's
children from captivity. The rest of the poem seems to be later; it tells how the earth shall rise again from the deep, and
the Aesir dwell once more in Odin's halls, and there is a suggestion of Christian influence in it which is absent from the
earlier part.

</p>
<p id="d0e181">Of the other general poems, the next four were probably composed before 950; in each the setting is different. <i>Vafthrudnismal</i>, a riddle-poem, shows Odin in a favourite position, seeking in disguise for knowledge of the future. Under the name of Gangrad
(Wanderer), he visits the wise giant Vafthrudni, and the two agree to test their wisdom: the one who fails to answer a question
is to forfeit his head. In each case the questions deal first with the past. Vafthrudni asks about Day and Night, and the
river which divides the Giants from the Gods, matters of common knowledge; and then puts a question as to the future: &#8220;What
is the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e186"></a>Page 7</span>plain where Surt and the blessed Gods shall meet in battle?&#8221; Odin replies, and proceeds to question in his turn; first about
the creation of Earth and Sky, the origin of Sun and Moon, Winter and Summer, the Giants and the Winds; the coming of Nj&ouml;rd
the Wane to the Aesir as a hostage; the Einherjar, or chosen warriors of Valhalla. Then come prophetic questions on the destruction
of the Sun by the wolf Fenri, the Gods who shall rule in the new world after Ragnar&ouml;k, the end of Odin. The poem is brought
to a close by Odin's putting the question which only himself can answer: &#8220;What did Odin say in his son's ear before he mounted
the pyre?&#8221; and the giant's head is forfeit.

</p>
<p id="d0e188">In the third poem of this class, <i>Grimnismal</i>, a prose introduction relates that Odin and Frigg quarrelled over the merits of their respective foster-children. To settle
the question, Odin goes disguised as Grimni, &#8220;the Hooded One,&#8221; to visit his foster-son Geirr&ouml;d; but Frigg, to justify her
charge of inhospitality against Geirr&ouml;d, sends her maiden Fulla to warn him against the coming stranger. Odin therefore meets
with a harsh reception, and is bound between two fires in the hall. Geirr&ouml;d's young son, Agnar, protests against this rude
treatment, and gives wine to the guest, who then begins to instruct him in matters concerning the Gods. He names the halls
of the Aesir, describes Valhalla and the ash Yggdrasil, the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e193"></a>Page 8</span>Valkyries, the creation of the world (two stanzas in common with <i>Vafthrudnismal</i>), and enumerates his own names. The poem ends with impressive abruptness by his turning to Geirr&ouml;d:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e199">&#8220;Thou art drunk, Geirr&ouml;d, thou hast drunk too deep; thou art bereft of much since thou hast lost my favour, the favour of
Odin and all the Einherjar. I have told thee much, but thou hast minded little. Thy friends betray thee: I see my friend's
sword lie drenched in blood. Now shall Odin have the sword-weary slain; I know thy life is ended, the Fates are ungracious.
Now thou canst see Odin: come near me, if thou canst.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e201">[Prose.] &#8220;King Geirr&ouml;d sat with his sword on his knee, half drawn. When he heard that Odin was there, he stood up and would
have led Odin from the fires. The sword slipt from his hand; the hilt turned downwards. The king caught his foot and fell
forwards, the sword standing towards him, and so he met his death. Then Odin went away, and Agnar was king there long afterwards.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e204"><i>Harbardsljod</i> is a dialogue, and humorous. Thor on his return from the east comes to a channel, at the farther side of which stands Odin,
disguised as a ferryman, Greybeard. He refuses to ferry Thor across, and they question each other as to their past feats,
with occasional threats from Thor and taunts from Odin, until the former goes off vowing vengeance on the ferryman:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e209"><span class="smallcaps">Thor</span>. &#8220;Thy skill in words would serve thee ill if I waded across the water; I think thou wouldst cry <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e213"></a>Page 9</span>louder than the wolf, if thou shouldst get a blow from the hammer.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e215"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;Sif has a lover at home, thou shouldst seek him. That is a task for thee to try, it is more proper for thee.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e219"><span class="smallcaps">Thor</span>. &#8220;Thou speakest what thou knowest most displeasing to me; thou cowardly fellow, I think that thou liest.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e223"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;I think I speak true; thou art slow on the road. Thou wouldst have got far, if thou hadst started at dawn.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e227"><span class="smallcaps">Thor</span>. &#8220;Harbard, scoundrel, it is rather thou who hast delayed me.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e231"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;I never thought a shepherd could so delay Asa-Thor's journey.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e235"><span class="smallcaps">Thor</span>. &#8220;I will counsel thee: row thy boat hither. Let us cease quarrelling; come and meet Magni's father.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e239"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;Leave thou the river; crossing shall be refused thee.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e243"><span class="smallcaps">Thor</span>. &#8220;Show me the way, since thou wilt not ferry me.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e247"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;That is a small thing to refuse. It is a long way to go: a while to the stock, and another to the stone, then keep to the
left hand till thou reach Verland. There will Fj&ouml;rgyn meet her son Thor, and she will tell him the highway to Odin's land.&#8221;


</p>
<p id="d0e251"><span class="smallcaps">Thor</span>. &#8220;Shall I get there to-day?&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e255"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;With toil and trouble thou wilt get there about sunrise, as I think.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e259"><span class="smallcaps">Thor</span>. &#8220;Our talk shall be short, since thou answerest with mockery. I will reward thee for refusing passage, if we two meet again.&#8221;


</p>
<p id="d0e263"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;Go thy way, where all the fiends may take thee.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e268"></a>Page 10</span></p>
<p id="d0e269"><i>Lokasenna</i> also is in dialogue form. A prose introduction tells how the giant Oegi, or Gymi, gave a feast to the Aesir. Loki was turned
out for killing a servant, but presently returned and began to revile the Gods and Goddesses, each one in turn trying to interfere,
only to provoke a taunt from Loki. At last Thor, who had been absent on a journey, came in and threatened the slanderer with
his hammer, whereupon Loki said, &#8220;I spoke to the Aesir and the sons of the Aesir what my mind told me; but for thee alone
I will go away, for I know thou wilt strike.&#8221; Some of the poem is rather pointless abuse, but much touches points already
suggested in the other poems.

</p>
<p id="d0e273"><i>Hyndluljod</i> is much later than the others, probably  not before 1200. The style is late, and the form imitated from <i>V&ouml;luspa</i>. It describes a visit paid by Freyja to the Sibyl to learn the genealogy of her favourite Ottar. The larger part deals with
heroic genealogies, but there are scanty allusions to Baldr, Frey, Heimdal, Loki's children, and Thor, and a Christian reference
to a God who shall come after Ragnar&ouml;k &#8220;when Odin shall meet the wolf.&#8221; It tells nothing new.

</p>
<p id="d0e280">We have here then, omitting <i>Hyndluljod</i>, five poems (four of them belonging to the first half of the tenth century) which suggest a general outline of Norse mythology:
there is a hierarchy of Gods, the Aesir, who live together in a citadel, Odin <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e285"></a>Page 11</span>being the chief. Among them are several who are not Aesir by origin: Nj&ouml;rd and his son and daughter, Frey and Freyja, are
Vanir; Loki is really an enemy and an agent in their fall; and there are one or two Goddesses of giant race. The giants are
rivals and enemies to the Gods; the dwarfs are also antagonistic, but in bondage. The meeting-place of the Gods is by the
World-Ash, Yggdrasil, on whose well-being the fate of Gods and men depends; at its root lies the World-Snake. The Gods have
foreknowledge of their own doom, Ragnar&ouml;k, the great fight when they shall meet Loki's children, the Wolf and the Snake; both
sides will fall and the world be destroyed. An episode in the story is the death of Baldr. This we may assume to be the religion
of the Viking age (800&#8211;1000 A.D.), a compound of the beliefs of various ages and tribes.

</p>
<p id="d0e287"><b>The Aesir.</b>&#8212;The number of the Aesir is not fixed. <i>Hyndluljod</i> says there were twelve (&#8220;there were eleven Aesir when Baldr went down into the howe&#8221;). Snorri gives a list of fourteen Aesir
or Gods (Odin, Thor, Baldr, Nj&ouml;rd, Frey, Tyr, Bragi, Heimdal, H&ouml;d, Vidar, Vali, Ullr, Forseti, Loki), and adds Hoeni in another
list, all the fifteen occurring in the poems; and sixteen Goddesses (Asynjor), the majority of whom are merely personified
epithets, occurring nowhere else. Of the sixteen, Frigg, Gefion, Freyja and Saga (really an <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e294"></a>Page 12</span>epithet only) are Goddesses in the poems, and Fulla is Frigg's handmaid. In another chapter, Snorri adds Idunn, Gerd, Sigyn
and Nanna, of whom the latter does not appear in the Elder Edda, where Idunn, Gerd (a giantess) and Sigyn are the wives of
Bragi, Frey and Loki; and two others, the giantess Skadi and Sif, are the wives of Nj&ouml;rd and Thor.

</p>
<p id="d0e296">A striking difference from classical mythology is that neither Tyr (who should etymologically be the Sky-god), nor Thor (the
Thunder-god), takes the highest place. Tyr is the hero of one important episode, the chaining of the Wolf, through which he
loses his right hand. This is told in full by Snorri and alluded to in <i>Lokasenna</i>, both in the prose preface (&#8220;Tyr also was there, with only one hand; the Fenris-wolf had bitten off the other, when he was
bound&#8221;) and in the poem itself:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e302"><span class="smallcaps">Loki</span>. &#8220;I must remember that right hand which Fenri bit off thee.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e306"><span class="smallcaps">Tyr</span>. &#8220;I am short of a hand, but thou of the famous wolf; to each the loss is ill-luck. Nor is the wolf in better plight, for
he must wait in bonds till Ragnar&ouml;k.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e311">Otherwise, he only appears in connexion with two more popular Gods: he speaks in Frey's defence in <i>Lokasenna</i>, and in <i>Hymiskvida</i> he is Thor's companion in the search for a cauldron; the latter poem represents him as a giant's son.

</p>
<p id="d0e319">Thor, on the other hand, is second only to his <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e321"></a>Page 13</span>father Odin; he is the strongest of the Gods and their champion against the giants, and his antagonist at Ragnar&ouml;k is to be
the World-Snake. Like Odin, he travels much, but while the chief God generally goes craftily and in disguise, to gain knowledge
or test his wisdom, Thor's errands are warlike; in <i>Lokasenna</i> he is absent on a journey, in <i>Harbardsljod</i>  and <i>Alvissmal</i> he is returning from one. His journeys are always to the east; so in <i>Harbardsljod</i>: &#8220;I was in the east, fighting the malevolent giant-brides.... I was in the east and guarding the river, when Svarang's sons
attacked me.&#8221; The Giants live in the east (<i>Hymiskvida</i> 5); Thor threatened Loki: &#8220;I will fling thee up into the east, and no one shall see thee more&#8221; (<i>Lokasenna</i> 59); the fire-giants at Ragnar&ouml;k are to come from the east: &#8220;Hrym comes driving from the east, he lifts his shield before
him.... A ship comes from the east, Muspell's sons will come sailing over the sea, and Loki steers&#8221; (<i>V&ouml;luspa</i> 50, 51). It would not, perhaps, be overstraining the point to suggest that this is a reminiscence of early warfare between
the Scandinavians and eastern nations, either Lapps and Finns or Slavonic tribes.

</p>
<p id="d0e344">Thor is the God of natural force, the son of Earth. Two of the episodical poems deal with his contests with the giants. <i>Thrymskvida</i>, the story of how Thor won back his hammer, Mj&ouml;llni, from the giant Thrym, is the finest and one of the oldest <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e349"></a>Page 14</span>of the mythological poems; a translation is given in the appendix, as an example of Eddic poetry at its best. Loki appears
as the willing helper of the Gods, and Thor's companion. The Thunderer's journey with Tyr in quest of a cauldron is related
with much humour in <i>Hymiskvida</i>: Hymi's beautiful wife, who helps her guests to outwit her husband, is a figure familiar in fairy-tales as the Ogre's wife.


</p>
<p id="d0e354">The chief God of the Scandinavians is, it must be confessed, an unsympathetic character. He is the head of the Valhalla system;
he is Val-father (Father of the Slain), and the Valkyries are his &#8220;Wishmaidens,&#8221; as the Einherjar are his &#8220;Wishsons.&#8221; He naturally
takes a special interest in mortal heroes, from whom come the chosen hosts of Valhalla. But, in spite of the splendour of
his surroundings, he is wanting in dignity. The chief of the Gods has neither the might and unthinking valour of Thor, nor
the self-sacrificing courage of Tyr. He is a God who practises magic, and it is as Father of Spells that he is powerful. He
is the wisest of the Gods in the sense that he remembers most about the past and foresees most about the future; yet he is
powerless in difficulty without the craft of Loki and the hammer of Thor. He always wanders in disguise, and the stories told
of him are chiefly love-adventures; this is true of all the deeds he mentions in <i>Harbardsljod</i>, and also of <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e359"></a>Page 15</span>the two interpolations in <i>Havamal</i>, though one of the two had an object, the stealing of the mead of inspiration from the giant Suptung, whose daughter Gunnl&ouml;d
guarded it.

</p>
<p id="d0e364"><i>V&ouml;luspa</i> makes him one of three creative deities, the other two being Lodur (probably Loki) and Hoeni, of whom nothing else is known
except the story that he was given as hostage to the Vanir in exchange for Nj&ouml;rd. The same three Gods (Odin, Loki and Hoeni)
are connected with the legend of the Nibelung treasure; and it was another adventure of theirs, according to Snorri, which
led to the loss of Idunn.

</p>
<p id="d0e368">Of the other Gods, Bragi is a later development; his name means simply king or chief, and his attributes, as God of eloquence
and poetry, are apparently borrowed from Odin. Heimdal, the watchman and &#8220;far-seeing like the Vanir,&#8221; who keeps guard on the
rainbow bridge Bifr&ouml;st, is represented in the curious poem <i>Rigsthula</i> as founder of the different social orders. He wandered over the world under the name of Rig, and from his first journey sprang
the race of thralls, swarthy, crooked and broad-backed, who busied themselves with fencing land and tending goats and swine;
from his second, the churls, fine and ruddy, who broke oxen, built houses and ploughed the land; from his third, the earls,
yellow-haired, rosy, and keen-eyed, who broke horses and strung bows, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e373"></a>Page 16</span>rode, swam, and hurled spears; and the youngest of the earls' race was Konung the king, who knew all mysteries, understood
the speech of birds, could quench fire and heal wounds. Heimdal is said to be the son of nine mothers, and to have fought
with Loki for Freyja's Brising-necklace. His horn is hidden under Yggdrasil, to be brought out at Ragnar&ouml;k, when he will blow
a warning blast. His origin is obscure. Still less is known of Vidar and Vali, two sons of Odin, one of whom is to avenge
Baldr's death, the other to slay the wolf after it has swallowed up the chief God at Ragnar&ouml;k. Thor's stepson Ullr (Glory)
is probably, like his sons Modi and Magni (Wrath and Strength), a mere epithet.

</p>
<p id="d0e375">Frigg, Odin's wife and the chief Goddess, daughter of Earth, is not very distinctly characterised, and is often confused with
Freyja. Gefion should be the sea-goddess, since that seems to be the meaning of her name, but her functions are apparently
usurped by the Wane Nj&ouml;rd; according to Snorri, she is the patron of those who die unwedded.

</p>
<p id="d0e377"><b>Baldr</b>.&#8212;The story of Baldr is the most debated point in the Edda. The chief theories advanced are: (1) That it is the oldest part
of Norse mythology, and of ritual origin; (2) that Baldr is really a hero transformed into a God; (3) that the legend <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e381"></a>Page 17</span>is a solar myth with or without Christian colouring;  (4) that it is entirely borrowed from Medi&aelig;val Greek and Christian sources.
This last theory is too ingenious to be credible; and with regard to the third, there is nothing essentially Christian in
the chief features of the legend, while the solar idea leaves too much unexplained. The references to the myth in the Elder
Edda are:

</p>
<p id="d0e383">(1) <i>Vegtamskvida</i> (about 900 A.D.). Odin questions the Sibyl as to the meaning of Baldr's dreams:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e389"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;For whom are the benches (in hell) strewn with rings, the halls fairly adorned with gold?&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e393"><span class="smallcaps">Sibyl</span>. &#8220;Here the mead, clear drink, stands brewed for Baldr; the shields are spread. The sons of the Aesir are too merry.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e397"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;Who will be Baldr's slayer and rob Odin's son of life?&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e401"><span class="smallcaps">Sibyl</span>. &#8220;H&ouml;d bears thither the high branch of fame: he will be Baldr's slayer and rob Odin's son of life.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e405"><span class="smallcaps">Odin</span>. &#8220;Who will avenge the deed on H&ouml;d and bring Baldr's slayer to the funeral pyre?&#8221;

to the pyre.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e414">(2) In <i>Lokasenna</i> Frigg says: &#8220;If I had a son like Baldr here in Oegi's halls, thou shouldst not pass out from the sons of the Aesir, but be
slain here in thy anger&#8221;; to which Loki replies, &#8220;Wilt thou that I speak more ill words, Frigg? I am <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e419"></a>Page 18</span>the cause that thou wilt never more see Baldr ride into the hall.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e421">(3) In <i>Vafthrudnismal</i> the only reference is Odin's question, &#8220;What said Odin in his son's ear when he mounted the pyre?&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e426">(4) In <i>V&ouml;luspa</i> the Sibyl prophesies, &#8220;I saw doom threatening Baldr, the bleeding victim, the son of Odin. Grown high above the meadows stood
the mistletoe, slender and fair. From this stem, which looked so slender, grew a fatal and dangerous shaft. H&ouml;d shot it, and
Frigg wept in Fenhall over Valhall's woe.&#8221;  The following lines, on the chaining of Loki, suggest his complicity.

</p>
<p id="d0e431">(5) <i>Hyndluljod</i> has one reference: &#8220;There were eleven Aesir by number when Baldr went down into the howe. Vali was his avenger and slew his
brother's slayer.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e436">Besides these there is a fragment quoted by Snorri: &#8220;Th&ouml;kk will weep dry tears at Baldr's funeral pyre. I had no good of the
old man's son alive or dead; let Hel keep what she has.&#8221; <i>Grimnismal</i> assigns a hall to Baldr among the Gods.

</p>
<p id="d0e441">There are, in addition, two prose versions of the story by later writers: the Icelandic version of Snorri (1178&#8211;1241) with
all the details familiar to every one; and the Latin one of the Dane Saxo Grammaticus (about thirty years earlier), which
makes Baldr and H&ouml;d heroes instead of Gods, and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e443"></a>Page 19</span>completely alters the character of the legend by making a rivalry for Nanna's favour the centre of the plot and cause of the
catastrophe. On the Eddic version and on Saxo's depend the theories of Golther, Detter, Niedner and other German scholars
on the one hand, and Dr. Frazer on the other.

</p>
<p id="d0e445">It has often been pointed out that there is no trace of Baldr-worship in other Germanic nations, nor in any of the Icelandic
sagas except the late Frithjofssaga. This, however, is true of other Gods, notably of Tyr, who is without question one of
the oldest. The only deities named with any suggestion of sacrifice or worship in the Icelandic sagas proper are Odin, Thor,
Frey, Nj&ouml;rd, Frigg and Freyja. The process of choice is as arbitrary in mythology as in other sciences. Again, it is more
likely that the original version of the legend should have survived in Iceland than in Denmark, which, being on the mainland,
was earlier subject to Christian and Romantic influences; and that a heathen God should, in the two or three centuries following
the establishment of Christianity in the North, be turned into a mortal hero, than that the reverse process should have acted
at a sufficiently late date to permit of both versions existing side by side in the thirteenth century. A similar gradual
elimination of the supernatural may be found in the history of the Volsung myth. Snorri's version is merely an amplification
of that in the Elder <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e447"></a>Page 20</span>Edda, which, scanty as its account of Baldr is, leaves no doubt as to his divinity.

</p>
<p id="d0e449">The outline gathered from the poems is as follows: Baldr, Odin's son, is killed by his brother H&ouml;d through a mistletoe spray;
Loki is in some way concerned in his death, which is an overwhelming misfortune to the Gods; but it is on H&ouml;d that his death
is avenged. He is burnt on a pyre (Snorri says on his ship, a feature which must come from the Viking age; <i>Hyndluljod</i> substitutes howe-burial). He will be absent from the great fight at Ragnar&ouml;k, but <i>V&ouml;luspa</i> adds that he will return afterwards. Nanna has nothing to do with the story. The connexion with the hierarchy of the Aesir
seems external only, since Baldr has no apparent relation to the great catastrophe as have Odin, Thor, Frej, Tyr and Loki;
this, then, would point to the independence of his myth.

</p>
<p id="d0e457">The genuineness of the myth seems to depend on whether the mistletoe is an original feature of it or not, and on this point
there can be little real doubt. The German theory that Baldr could only be killed by his own sword, which was therefore disguised
by enchantment and used against him, and that the Icelandic writers misunderstood this to mean a mistletoe sprig, is far-fetched
and romantic, and crumbles at a touch. For if, as it is claimed, the Icelanders had no mistletoe, why should they introduce
it into a story to which it did not belong? <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e459"></a>Page 21</span>They might preserve it by tradition, but they would hardly invent it. Granting this, the mistletoe becomes the central point
of the legend. The older mythologists, who only saw in it a sun-myth, overlooked the fact that since any weapon would have
done to kill the God with, the mistletoe must have some special significance; and if it is a genuine part of the story, as
we have no reason to doubt, it will be hard to overturn Dr. Frazer's theory that the Baldr-myth is a relic of tree-worship
and the ritual sacrifice of the God, Baldr being a tree-spirit whose soul is contained in the mistletoe.

</p>
<p id="d0e461">The contradictions in the story, especially as told by Snorri (such as the confusion between the parts played by H&ouml;d and Loki,
and the unsuspicious attitude of the Gods as Loki directs H&ouml;d's aim) are sometimes urged against its genuineness. They are
rather proofs of antiquity. Apparent contradictions whose explanation is forgotten often survive in tradition; the inventor
of a new story takes care to make it consistent. It is probable, however, that there were originally only two actors in the
episode, the victim and the slayer, and that Loki's part is later than H&ouml;d's, for he really belongs to the Valhall and Ragnar&ouml;k
myth, and was only introduced here as a link. The incident of the oath extracted from everything on earth to protect Baldr,
which occurs in Snorri and in a paper MS. of <i>Baldr's Dreams</i>, was probably invented to <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e466"></a>Page 22</span>explain the choice of weapon, which would certainly need explanation to an Icelandic audience. If Dr. Frazer's theory be right,
Vali, who slew the slayer, must also have been an original figure in the legend. His antiquity is supported by the fact that
he plays the part of avenger in the poems; while in Snorri, where he is mentioned as a God, his absence from the account of
Baldr's death is only a part of that literary development by which real responsibility for the murder was transferred from
H&ouml;d to Loki.

</p>
<p id="d0e468">Snorri gives Baldr a son, Forseti (Judge), who is also named as a God in <i>Grimnismal</i>. He must have grown out of an epithet of Baldr's, of whom Snorri says that &#8220;no one can resist his sentence&#8221;; the sacred tree
would naturally be the seat of judgment.

<p id="d0e473"><b>The Wanes.</b>&#8212;Three of the Norse divinities, Nj&ouml;rd and his son and daughter, are not Aesir by descent. The following account is given of
their presence in Asgard:

</p>
<p id="d0e477">(1) In <i>Vafthrudnismal</i>, Odin asks:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e483">&#8220;Whence came Nj&ouml;rd among the sons of the Aesir? for he was not born of the Aesir.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e485"><span class="smallcaps">Vafthrudni</span>. &#8220;In Vanaheim wise powers ordained and gave him for a hostage to the Gods; at the doom of the world he shall come back, home
to the wise Wanes.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e490"></a>Page 23</span></p>
<p id="d0e491">(2) There is an allusion in <i>V&ouml;luspa</i> to the war which caused the giving of hostages:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e497">&#8220;Odin shot into the host: this was the first war in the world. Broken was the wall of the citadel of the Aesir, so that the
Wanes could tread the fields of war.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e500">(3) Loki taunts Nj&ouml;rd with his position, in <i>Lokasenna</i>:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e506">&#8220;Thou wast sent from the east as a hostage to the Gods....&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e508"><span class="smallcaps">Nj&ouml;rd</span>. &#8220;This is my comfort, though I was sent from far as a hostage to the Gods, yet I have a son whom no one hates, and he is
thought the best of the Aesir.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e512"><span class="smallcaps">Loki</span>. &#8220;Stay, Nj&ouml;rd, restrain thy pride; I will hide it no longer: thy son is thine own sister's son, and that is no worse than
one would expect.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e516"><span class="smallcaps">Tyr</span>. &#8220;Frey is the best of all the bold riders of Asgard.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e521">There is little doubt that Nj&ouml;rd was once a God of higher importance than he is in the Edda, where he is overshadowed by his
son. Grimm's suggestion that he and the goddess Nerthus, mentioned by Tacitus, were brother and sister, is supported by the
line in <i>Lokasenna</i>; it is an isolated reference, and the Goddess has left no other traces in Scandinavian mythology. They were the deities,
probably agricultural, of an earlier age, whose adoption by the later Northmen was explained by the story of the compact between
Aesir and Vanir. Then <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e526"></a>Page 24</span>their places were usurped by Frey and Freyja, who were possibly created out of epithets originally applied to the older pair;
Nj&ouml;rd was retained with lessened importance, Nerthus passed out altogether. The Edda gives Nj&ouml;rd a giant-bride, Skadi, who
was admitted among the Gods in atonement for the slaying of her father Thiazi; she is little more than a name. Frey and Freyja
have other marks of agricultural deities, besides their relationship. Nothing is said about Frey's changing shape, but Freyja
possesses a hawk-dress which Loki borrows when he wishes to change his form; and, according to Snorri, Frey was sacrificed
to for the crops. Nj&ouml;rd has an epithet, &#8220;the wealthy,&#8221; which may have survived from his earlier connexion with the soil. In
that case, it would explain why, in Snorri and elsewhere, he is God of the sea and ships, once the province of the ocean-goddess
Gefion; the transference is a natural one to an age whose wealth came from the sea.

</p>
<p id="d0e528">In spite of their origin, Frey and Freyja become to all intents and purposes Aesir. Frey is to be one of the chief combatants
at Ragnar&ouml;k, with the fire-giant Surt for his antagonist, and a story is told to explain his defeat: he fell in love with
Gerd, a giant-maid, and sacrificed his sword to get her; hence he is weaponless at the last fight. Loki alludes to this episode
in <i>Lokasenna</i>: &#8220;With gold didst thou buy Gymi's daughter, and gavest <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e533"></a>Page 25</span>thy sword for her; but when Muspell's sons ride over Myrkwood, thou shalt not know with what to fight, unhappy one.&#8221; The story
is told in full in <i>Skirnisf&ouml;r</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e538">Freyja is called by Snorri &#8220;the chief Goddess after Frigg,&#8221; and the two are sometimes confused. Like her father and brother,
she comes into connexion with the giants; she is the beautiful Goddess, and coveted by them. <i>V&ouml;luspa</i> says that the Gods went into consultation to discuss &#8220;who had given the bride of Od (<i>i.e.</i>, Freyja) to the giant race&#8221;; <i>Thrymskvida</i> relates how the giant Thrym bargained for Freyja as the ransom for Thor's hammer, which he had hidden, and how Loki and Thor
outwitted him; and Snorri says the giants bargained for her as the price for building Valhalla, but were outwitted. Sir G.W.
Dasent notices in the folk-tales the eagerness of trolls and giants to learn the details of the agricultural processes, and
this is probably the clue to the desire of the Frost-Giants in the Edda for the possession of Freyja. Idunn, the wife of Bragi,
and a purely Norse creation, seems to be a double of Freyja; she, too, according to Snorri, is carried away by the giants
and rescued by Loki. The golden apples which she is to keep till Ragnar&ouml;k remind us of those which Frey offered to Gerd; and
the gift of eternal youth, of which they are the symbols, would be appropriate enough to Freyja as an agricultural deity.

<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e549"></a>Page 26</span></p>
<p id="d0e550">The great necklace Brising, stolen by Loki and won back in fight by Heimdal (according to the tenth-century Skalds Thjodulf
and Ulf Uggason), is Freyja's property. On this ground, she has been identified with the heroine of <i>Svipdag and Menglad</i>, a poem undoubtedly old, though it has only come down in paper MSS. It is in two parts, the first telling how Svipdag aroused
the Sibyl Groa, his mother, to give him spells to guard him on his journey; the second describing his crossing the wall of
fire which surrounded his fated bride Menglad. If Menglad is really Freyja, the &#8220;Necklace-glad,&#8221; it is a curious coincidence
that one poem connects the waverlowe, or ring of fire, with Frey also; for his bride Gerd is protected in the same way, though
his servant Skirni goes through it in his place:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e556"><span class="smallcaps">Skirni</span>. &#8220;Give me the horse that will bear me through the dark magic waverlowe, and the sword that fights of itself against the giant-race.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e560"><span class="smallcaps">Frey</span>. &#8220;I give thee the horse that will bear thee through the dark magic waverlowe, and the sword that will fight of itself if
he is bold who bears it.&#8221; (<i>Skirnisf&ouml;r</i>.)
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e568">The connexion of both with the Midsummer fires, originally part of an agricultural ritual, can hardly be doubted.

</p>
<p id="d0e570"><b>Loki</b>, or Lopt, is a strange figure. He is admitted among the Aesir, though not one of them <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e574"></a>Page 27</span>by birth, and his whole relation to them points to his being an older elemental God. He is in alliance with them against the
giants; he and Odin have sworn blood-brothership, according to <i>Lokasenna</i>, and he helps Thor to recover his hammer that Asgard may be defended against the giants. On the other hand, while in present
alliance with the Gods, he is chief agent in their future destruction, and this they know. In Snorri, he is a mischievous
spirit of the fairy-tale kind, exercising his ingenuity alternately in getting the Gods into difficulties, and in getting
them out again. So he betrays Idunn to the giants, and delivers her; he makes the bargain by which Freyja is promised to the
giant-builders of Valhalla, and invents the trick by which they are cheated of their prize; by killing the otter he endangers
his own head, Odin's and Hoeni's, and he obtains the gold which buys their atonement. Hence, in the systematising of the Viking
religion, the responsibility for Baldr's death also was transferred to him. At the coming of the fire-giants at Ragnar&ouml;k,
he is to steer the ship in which Muspell's sons sail (<i>V&ouml;luspa</i>), further evidence of his identity as a fire-spirit. Like his son the Wolf, he is chained by the Gods; the episode is related
in a prose-piece affixed to <i>Lokasenna</i>:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e586">&#8220;After that Loki hid himself in Franangr's Foss in the form of a salmon. There the Aesir caught him. He was bound with the
guts of his son Nari, but his <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e588"></a>Page 28</span>son Narfi was changed into a wolf. Skadi took a poisonous snake and fastened it up over Loki's face, and the poison dropped
down. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat there and held a cup under the poison. But when it was full she poured the poison away, and
meanwhile poison dropped on Loki, and he struggled so hard that all the earth shook; those are called earthquakes now.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e591"><i>V&ouml;luspa</i> inserts lines corresponding to this passage after the Baldr episode, and Snorri makes it a consequence of Loki's share in
that event.

</p>
<p id="d0e595">He is more especially agent of the doom through his children: at Ragnar&ouml;k, Fenri the Wolf, bound long before by Tyr's help,
will be freed, and swallow the sun (<i>Vafthrudnismal</i>) and Odin (<i>Vafthrudnismal</i> and <i>V&ouml;luspa</i>); and J&ouml;rmungandr, the Giant-Snake, will rise from the sea where he lies curled round the world, to slay and be slain by
Thor. The dragon's writhing in the waves is one of the tokens to herald Ragnar&ouml;k, and his battle with Thor is the fiercest
combat of that day. Only <i>V&ouml;luspa</i> of our poems gives any account of it: &#8220;Then comes the glorious son of Hlodyn, Odin's son goes to meet the serpent; Midgard's
guardian slays him in his rage, but scarcely can Earth's son reel back nine feet from the dragon.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e609">When Thor goes fishing with the giant Hymi, he terrifies his companion by dragging the snake's head out of the sea, but he
does not slay it; it must wait there till Ragnar&ouml;k:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e614">&#8220;The protector of men, the only slayer of the Serpent, baited his hook with the ox's head. The God-hated one who girds all
lands from below swallowed the bait. Doughtily pulled mighty Thor the poison-streaked serpent up to the side; he struck down
with his hammer the hideous head of the wolf's companion. The monster roared, the wilderness resounded, the old earth shuddered
all through. The fish sank back into the sea. Gloomy was the giant when they rowed back, so that he spoke not a word.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e617">There is nothing to suggest that J&ouml;rmungandr, to whom the word World-Snake (Midgardsorm) always refers in the Edda, is the
same as Nidh&ouml;gg, the serpent that gnaws at Yggdrasil's roots; but both are relics of Snake-worship.

</p>
<p id="d0e619"><b>The World-Ash</b>, generally called Yggdrasil's Ash, is one of the most interesting survivals of tree-worship. It is described by the Sibyl
in <i>V&ouml;luspa</i>: &#8220;I know an ash called Yggdrasil, a high tree sprinkled with white moisture (thence come the dews that fall in the dales):
it stands ever-green by Urd's spring. Thence come three maids, all-knowing, from the hall that stands under the tree&#8221;; and
as a sign of the approaching doom she says: &#8220;Yggdrasil's ash trembles as it stands; the old tree groans.&#8221; <i>Grimnismal</i> says that the Gods go every day to hold judgment by the ash, and describes it further:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e630">&#8220;Three roots lie three ways under Yggdrasil's ash: Hel dwells under one, the frost-giants under the second, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e632"></a>Page 30</span>mortal men under the third. The squirrel is called Ratatosk who shall run over Yggdrasil's ash; he shall carry down the eagle's
words, and tell them to Nidh&ouml;gg below. There are four harts, with necks thrown back, who gnaw off the shoots.... More serpents
lie under Yggdrasil's ash than any one knows. Ofni and Svafni I know will ever gnaw at the tree's twigs. Yggdrasil's ash suffers
more hardships than men know: the hart bites above, the side decays, and Nidh&ouml;gg gnaws below.... Yggdrasil's ash is the best
of trees.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e635">The snake and the tree are familiar in other mythologies, though in most other cases the snake is the protector, while here
he is the destroyer. Both Nidh&ouml;gg and J&ouml;rmungandr are examples of the destroying dragon rather than the treasure-guardian.
The Ash is the oracle: the judgment-place of the Gods, the dwelling of the Fates, the source of the spring of knowledge.

</p>
<p id="d0e637"><b>Ragnar&ouml;k</b>.&#8212;The Twilight of the Gods (or Doom of the Gods) is the central point of the Viking religion. The Regin (of which <i>Ragna</i> is genitive plural) are the ruling powers, often called Ginnregin (the great Gods), Uppregin (the high Gods), Thrymregin
(the warrior Gods). The word is commonly used of the Aesir in <i>V&ouml;luspa</i>; in <i>Alvissmal</i> the Regin seem to be distinguished from both Aesir and Vanir. The whole story of the Aesir is overshadowed by knowledge of
this coming doom, the time when they shall meet foes more terrible than the giants, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e650"></a>Page 31</span>and fall before them; their constant effort is to learn what will happen then, and to gather their forces together to meet
it. The coming Ragnar&ouml;k is the reason for the existence of Valhalla with its hosts of slain warriors; and of all the Gods,
Odin, Thor, Tyr and Loki are most closely connected with it. Two poems of the verse Edda describe it:

<p id="d0e687">The following lines tell of the fire-giants and the various combats, and the last section of the poem deals with a new world
when Baldr, H&ouml;d and Hoeni are to come back to the dwelling-place of the Gods.

</p>
<p id="d0e689">The whole points to a belief in the early destruction of the world and the passing away of the old order of things. Whether
the new world which <i>Vafthrudnismal</i> and <i>V&ouml;luspa</i> both prophesy belongs to the original idea or not is a disputed point. Probably it does not; at all events, none of the old
Aesir, according to the poems, are to survive, for Modi and Magni are not really Gods at all, Baldr, H&ouml;d and Vali belong to
another myth, Hoeni had passed out of the hierarchy by his exchange with Nj&ouml;rd, and Vidar's origin is obscure.

</p>
<p id="d0e697"><b>The Einherjar</b>, the great champions or chosen warriors, are intimately connected with Ragnar&ouml;k. All warriors who fall in battle are taken
to Odin's hall of the slain, Valhalla. According to <i>Grimnismal</i>, he &#8220;chooses every day men dead by the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e704"></a>Page 33</span>sword&#8221;; his Valkyries ride to battle to give the victory and bring in the fallen. Hence Odin is the giver of victory. Loki
in <i>Lokasenna</i> taunts him with giving victory to the wrong side: &#8220;Thou hast never known how to decide the battle among men. Thou hast often
given victory to those to whom thou shouldst not give it, to the more cowardly&#8221;; this, no doubt, was in order to secure the
best fighters for Valhalla. That the defeated side sometimes consoled themselves with this explanation of a notable warrior's
fall is proved by the tenth-century dirge on Eirik Bloodaxe, where Sigmund the Volsung asks in Valhalla: &#8220;Why didst thou take
the victory from him, if thou thoughtest him brave?&#8221; and Odin replies: &#8220;Because it is uncertain when the grey Wolf will come
to the seat of the Gods.&#8221; There are similar lines in Eyvind's dirge on Hakon the Good. In this way a host was collected ready
for Ragnar&ouml;k: for <i>Grimnismal</i>  says: &#8220;There are five hundred doors and eighty in Valhalla; eight hundred Einherjar will go out from each door, when they
go to fight the wolf.&#8221; Meanwhile they fight and feast: &#8220;All the Einherjar in Odin's courts fight every day: they choose the
slain and ride from the battle, and sit then in peace together&#8221; (<i>Vafthrudnismal</i>,) and the Valkyries bear ale to them <i>(Grimnismal</i>).

</p>
<p id="d0e718">It is often too hastily assumed that the Norse Ragnar&ouml;k with the dependant Valhalla system are <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e720"></a>Page 34</span>in great part the outcome of Christian influence: of an imitation of the Christian Judgment Day and the Christian heaven respectively.
Owing to the lateness of our material, it is, of course, impossible to decide how old the beliefs may be, but it is likely
that the Valhalla idea only took form at the systematising of the mythology in the Viking age. The belief in another world
for the dead is, however, by no means exclusively Christian, and a reference in <i>Grimnismal</i> suggests the older system out of which, under the influence of the Ragnar&ouml;k idea, Valhalla was developed. The lines, &#8220;The
ninth hall is Folkvang, where Freyja rules the ordering of seats in the hall; half the slain she chooses every day, Odin has
the other half,&#8221; are an evident survival of a belief that all the dead went to live with the Gods, Odin having the men, and
Freyja (or more probably Frigg) the women; the idea being here confused with the later system, under which only those who
fell in battle were chosen by the Gods. Christian colouring appears in the last lines of <i>V&ouml;luspa</i> and in Snorri, where men are divided into the &#8220;good and moral,&#8221; who go after death to a hall of red gold, and the &#8220;perjurers
and murderers,&#8221; who are sent to a hall of snakes.

</p>
<p id="d0e728">For Ragnar&ouml;k also a heathen origin is at least as probable as a Christian one. I would suggest as a possibility that the expectation
of the Twilight of <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e730"></a>Page 35</span>the Gods may have grown out of some ritual connected with the eclipse, such as is frequent among heathen races. Such ceremonies
are a tacit acknowledgment of a doubt, and if they ever existed among the Scandinavians, the possibility, ever present to
the savage mind, of a time when his efforts to help the light might be fruitless, and the darkness prove the stronger, would
be the germ of his more civilised descendant's belief in Ragnar&ouml;k.

</p>
<p id="d0e732">By turning to the surviving poems of the Skalds, whose dates can be approximately reckoned from the sagas, we can fix an inferior
limit for certain of the legends given above, placing them definitely in the heathen time. Reference has already been made
to the corroboration of the Valhalla belief supplied by the elegies on Eirik Bloodaxe and Hakon the Good. In the former (which
is anonymous, but must have been written soon after 950, since it was composed, on Eirik's death, by his wife's orders), Odin
commands the Einherjar and Valkyries to prepare for the reception of the slain Eirik and his host, since no one knows how
soon the Gods will need to gather their forces together for the great contest. Eyvind's dirge on Hakon (who fell in 970) is
an imitation of this: Odin sends two Valkyries to choose a king to enter his service in Valhalla; they find Hakon on the battle-field,
and he is slain with many of his followers. Great <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e734"></a>Page 36</span>preparation is made in Valhalla for his reception, and the poet ends by congratulating Hakon (who, though a Christian, having
been educated in England, had not interfered with the heathen altars and sacrifices) on the toleration which has secured him
such a welcome. A still earlier poet, Hornklofi, writing during the reign of Harald Fairhair (who died in 933), alludes to
the slain as the property of &#8220;the one-eyed husband of Frigg.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e736">Several Skalds mention legends of Thor: his fishing for the World-Snake is told by Bragi (who from his place in genealogies
must have written before 900), and by Ulf Uggason and Eystein Valdason, both in the second half of the tenth century; and
Thjodulf and Eilif (the former about 960, the latter a little later) tell tales of his fights with the giants. Turning to
the other Gods, Egil Skallagrimsson (about 970) names Frey and Nj&ouml;rd as the givers of wealth; Bragi tells the story of Gefion's
dragging the island of Zealand out of Lake Wener into the sea; and Ulf Uggason speaks of Heimdal's wrestling with Loki.

</p>
<p id="d0e738">The legend of Idunn is told by Thjodulf much as Snorri tells it: Odin, Hoeni and Loki, while on a journey, kill and roast
an ox. The giant Thiazi swoops down in eagle's shape and demands a share; Loki strikes the eagle, who flies off with him,
releasing him only on condition that he will betray to the giants Idunn, &#8220;the care-healing maid who <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e740"></a>Page 37</span>understands the renewal of youth.&#8221; He does so, and the Gods, who grow old and withered for want of her apples, force him to
go and bring her back to Asgard.

</p>
<p id="d0e742">The poet of <i>Eiriksmal</i>, quoted above, alludes to the Baldr myth: Bragi, hearing the approach of Eirik and his host, asks &#8220;What is that thundering
and tramping, as if Baldr were coming back to Odin's hall?&#8221; The funeral pyre of Baldr is described by Ulf Uggason: he is burnt
on his ship, which is launched by a giantess, in the presence of Frey, Heimdal, Odin and the Valkyries.

</p>
<p id="d0e747">Though heathen writers outside of Scandinavia are lacking, references to Germanic heathendom fortunately survive in several
Continental Christian historians of earlier date than any of our Scandinavian sources. The evidence of these, though scanty,
is corroborative, and the allusions are in striking agreement with the Edda stories in tone and character.

</p>
<p id="d0e749">Odin (Wodanus) is always identified by these writers with the Roman Mercurius (whom Tacitus named as the chief German God).
This identification occurs in the eighth-century Paulus Diaconus, and in Jonas of Bobbio (first half of the seventh century),
and probably rests on Odin's character as a wandering God (Mercury being <span class="Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8049;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>), his disguises, and his patronage of poetry and eloquence (as Mercury is <span class="Greek">&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>). Odin <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e757"></a>Page 38</span>is not himself in general the conductor of dead souls (<span class="Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#960;&#8057;&#962;</span>), like the Roman God, his attendant Valkyries performing the office for him. The equation is only comprehensible on the presumption
of the independence of Germanic mythology, and cannot be explained by transmission. For if Odin were in any degree an imitation
of the Roman deity, other notable attributes of the latter would have been assigned to him: whereas in the Edda the thieving
God (<span class="Greek">&#954;&#955;&#8051;&#960;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>) is not Odin but Loki, and the founder of civilisation is Heimdal.

</p>
<p id="d0e765">The legend of the origin of the Lombards given by Paulus Diaconus illustrates the relations of Odin and Frigg. The Vandals
asked Wodan (Odin) to grant them victory over the Vinili; the latter made a similar prayer to Frea (Frigg), the wife of Wodan.
She advised them to make their wives tie their hair round their faces like beards, and go with them to meet Wodan in the morning.
They did so, and Wodan exclaimed, &#8220;Who are these <i>Long-beards</i>?&#8221; Then Frea said that having given the Vinili a name, he must give them the victory (as Helgi in the Edda claims a gift from
Svava when she names him). As in <i>Grimnismal</i>, Odin and Frigg are represented as supporting rival claims, and Frigg gains the day for her favourites by superior cunning.
This legend also shows Odin as the giver of victory.

</p>
<p id="d0e773">Few heathen legends are told however by these <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e775"></a>Page 39</span>early Christian writers, and the Gods are seldom called by their German names. An exception is the Frisian Fosite mentioned
by Alcuin (who died 804) and by later writers; he is to be identified with the Norse Forseti, the son of (probably at first
an epithet of) Baldr, but no legend of him is told. It is disappointing that these writers should have said so little of any
God except the chief one. A very characteristic touch survives in Gregory of Tours (died 594), when the Frank Chlodvig tells
his Christian wife that the Christian God &#8220;cannot be proved to be of the race of the Gods,&#8221; an idea entirely in keeping with
the Eddic hierarchy. Before leaving the Continental historians, reference may be made to the abundant evidence of Germanic
tree-worship to be gathered from them. The holy oak mentioned by Wilibald (before 786), the sacred pear-tree of Constantius
(473), with numerous others, supply parallels to the World-Ash which is so important a feature of Norse mythology.

</p>
<p id="d0e777">A study of this subject would be incomplete without some reference to the mythology of Saxo Grammaticus. His testimony on
the old religion is unwilling, and his effort to discredit it very evident. The bitterness of his attack on Frigg especially
suggests that she was, among the Northmen, a formidable rival to the Virgin. When he repeats a legend of the Gods, he transforms
them into <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e779"></a>Page 40</span>mortal heroes, and when, as often happens, he refers to them accidentally as Gods, he invariably hastens to protest that he
does so only because it had been the custom. He describes Thor and Odin as men versed in sorcery who claimed the rank of Gods;
and in another passage he speaks of the latter as a king who had his seat at Upsala, and who was falsely credited with divinity
throughout Europe. His description of Odin agrees with that in the Edda: an old man of great stature and mighty in battle,
one-eyed, wearing a great cloak, and constantly wandering about in disguise. The story which Saxo tells of his driving into
battle with Harald War-tooth, disguised as the latter's charioteer Brun, and turning the fight against him by revealing to
his enemy Ring the order of battle which he had invented for Harald's advantage, is in thorough agreement with the traditional
character of the God who betrayed Sigmund the Volsung and Helgi Hundingsbane. Saxo's version of the Baldr story has been mentioned
already. Baldr's transformation into a hero (who could only be slain by a sword in the keeping of a wood-satyr) is almost
complete. But Odin and Thor and all the Gods fight for him against his rival Hother, &#8220;so that it might be called a battle
of Gods against men&#8221;; and Nanna's excuse to Baldr that &#8220;a God could not wed with a mortal,&#8221; preserves a trace of his origin.
The chained Loki appears in Saxo as <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e781"></a>Page 41</span>Utgarda-Loki, lying bound in a cavern of snakes, and worshipped as a God by the Danish king Gorm Haraldsson. Dr. Eydberg sees
the Freyja myth in Saxo's story of Syritha, who was carried away by the giants and delivered by her lover Othar (the Od of
the Edda): an example, like <i>Svipdag and Menglad</i>, of the complete transformation of a divine into an heroic myth. In almost all cases Saxo vulgarises the stories in the telling,
a common result when a mythical tale is retold by a Christian writer, though it is still more conspicuous in his versions
of the heroic legends.

<p id="d0e799">3. They went to the dwelling of fair Freyja, and these words he spoke first of all: &#8220;Wilt thou lend me, Freyja, thy feather

<p id="d0e824">9. Then Loki flew, the feather-coat rustled, until he came out of J&ouml;tunheim and into Asgard. Thor met <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e826"></a>Page 43</span>him in the middle of the court, and these words he spoke first:

</p>
<p id="d0e828">10. &#8220;Hast thou news in proportion to thy toil? Tell me from on high thy distant tidings, for a sitting man often breaks down
in his story, and he who lies down falls into falsehood.&#8221;

<p id="d0e830">11. <span class="smallcaps">Loki</span>. &#8220;I bring news for my toil: Thrym, lord of the Giants, has thy hammer; no man shall bring it back, unless he take him Freyja

<p id="d0e835">12. They went to see fair Freyja, spoke to her first of all these words: &#8220;Bind on the bridal veil, Freyja, we two must drive
to J&ouml;tunheim.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e837">13. Angry then was Freyja; she panted, so that all the hall of the Aesir trembled, and the great Brising necklace fell: &#8220;Eager
indeed for marriage wouldst thou think me, if I should drive with thee to J&ouml;tunheim.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e839">14. Then all the Aesir went into council, and all the Asynjor to consultation, and the mighty Gods discussed how they should
recover the Thunderer's hammer.

</p>
<p id="d0e841">15. Then spoke Heimdal, whitest of the Aesir; he could see into the future like the Vanir: &#8220;Let us bind on Thor the bridal
veil; let him have the great necklace Brising.

</p>
<p id="d0e843">16. &#8220;Let the keys jingle, and let women's weeds fall about his knees; let us put broad stones on his breast, and a hood dexterously
on his head.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e845">17. Then spoke Thor, the mighty Asa: &#8220;Vile would the Aesir call me, if I let the bridal veil be bound on me.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e847">18. Then spoke Loki, Laufey's son: &#8220;Speak not such words, Thor! soon will the Giants dwell in Asgard, unless thou bring home
thy hammer.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e849">19. Then they bound on Thor the bridal veil, and the great necklace Brising; they let the keys jingle and women's weeds fall
about his knees, and they put broad <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e851"></a>Page 44</span>stones on his breast, and the hood dexterously on his head.

</p>
<p id="d0e853">20. Then spoke Loki, Laufey's son: &#8220;I also will go with thee as thy maiden; we two will drive together to J&ouml;tunheim.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e855">21. Then the goats were driven out, urged forward in their harness; well must they run. Rocks were riven, the earth burned
in name: Odin's son was driving into J&ouml;tunheim.

Nj&ouml;rd's daughter from Noatun.

<p id="d0e859">23. &#8220;Gold-horned kine run in the court, oxen all-black, the giant's delight. I have many treasures, I have many jewels, Freyja
only is lacking.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e861">24. The guests assembled early in the evening, and ale was carried to the Giants. One ox did Sif's husband eat, and eight
salmon, and all the dishes prepared for the women; three casks of mead he drank.

</p>
<p id="d0e863">25. Then spoke Thrym, lord of the Giants: &#8220;Who ever saw a bride eat so eagerly? I never saw a bride make such a hearty meal,
nor a maid drink so deep of mead.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e865">26. The prudent handmaid sat near, and she found answer to the Giant's words: &#8220;Eight nights has Freyja eaten nothing, so eager
was she to be in J&ouml;tunheim.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e867">27. He looked under the veil, he longed to kiss the bride, but he started back the length of the hall: &#8220;Why are Freyja's eyes
so terrible? Fire seems to burn from her eyes.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e869">28. The prudent handmaid sat near, and she found answer to the Giant's speech: &#8220;Eight nights has Freyja had no sleep, so eager
was she to be in J&ouml;tunheim.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e871">29. In came the Giants' wretched sister, she dared to ask for a bridal gift: &#8220;Take from thine arms the red rings, if thou
wouldst gain my love, my love and all my favour.&#8221;

<p id="d0e874">30. Then spoke Thrym, lord of the Giants: &#8220;Bring the hammer to hallow the bride. Lay Mj&ouml;llni on the maiden's knee, hallow
us two in wedlock.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e876">31. The Thunderer's heart laughed in his breast, when the bold of soul felt the hammer. Thrym killed he first, the lord of
the Giants, and all the race of the Giants he struck.

</p>
<p id="d0e878">32. He slew the Giants' aged sister, who had asked him for a bridal gift. She got a blow instead of shillings, and a stroke
of the hammer for abundance of rings. So Odin's son got back his hammer.

<p id="d0e887">(1) <i>Poetic Edda</i>.&#8212;The classic edition, and on the whole the best, is Professor Bugge's (Christiania, 1867); the smaller editions of Hildebrand
(<i>Die Lieder der Aelteren Edda</i>, Paderborn, 1876), and Finnur J&oacute;nsson (<i>Eddalieder</i>, Halle, 1888&#8211;90) are also good; the latter is in two parts, <i>G&ouml;ttersage</i> and <i>Heldensage</i>. The poems may also be found in the first volume of Vigfusson and Powell's <i>Corpus Poeticum Boreale</i> (Oxford, 1883), accompanied by translations;  but in many cases they are cut up and rearranged, and they suffer metrically
from the system adopted of printing two short lines as one long one, with no dividing point. There is an excellent palaeographic
edition of the <i>Codex Regius of the Elder Edda</i>, by Wimmer and Finnur J&oacute;nsson (Copenhagen, 1891), with photographic reproductions interleaved with a literal transcription.


</p>
<p id="d0e910">(2) <i>Snorra Edda</i>.&#8212;The most recent edition of the whole is Dr. Finnur J&oacute;nsson's (Copenhagen, 1875). There is a useful edition of the mythological
portions <i>(i.e., Gylfaginning, Bragaraedur</i>, and the narrative parts of <i>Skaldskaparmal</i>) by Ernst Wilken (<i>Die Pros&auml;ische Edda</i>, Paderborn, 1878).

</p>
<p id="d0e924">(3) <i>Dictionaries and Grammars</i>.&#8212;For the study of the Poetic Edda, Gering's <i>Glossar zu den Liedern der Edda</i> (Paderborn, 1896) will be found most useful; it is complete <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e932"></a>Page 47</span>and trustworthy, and in small compass. A similar service has been performed for <i>Snorra Edda</i> in Wilken's <i>Glossar</i> (Paderborn, 1883), which forms a second volume to his edition, mentioned above. Both are, of course, in German. The only
English dictionary is the lexicon of Cleasby and Vigfusson (Oxford).

</p>
<p id="d0e940">Of Grammars, the best are German; those of Noreen (<i>Altnordische Grammatik</i>, Halle, 1892), of which there is an abbreviated edition, and Kahle (<i>Altisl&auml;ndisches Elementarbuch</i>, Heidelberg, 1896) being better suited for advanced students; the English grammars included in Vigfusson and Powell's <i>Icelandic Reader</i> (Oxford) and Sweet's <i>Icelandic Primer</i> (Oxford) are more elementary, and therefore hardly adequate for the study of the verse literature.

</p><a id="d0e954"></a><h2>II. Translations.</h2>
<p id="d0e957">There are English translations of the Elder Edda by Anderson (Chicago, 1879) and Thorpe (1866), as well as the translations
in the <i>Corpus Poeticum</i>, which are, of course, liable to the same objection as the text. The most accurate German translation is Gering's (Leipzig,
1893); in Simrock's (<i>Aeltere und J&uuml;ngere Edda</i>, Stuttgart, 1882), the translations of the verse Edda are based on an uncritical text. Snorra Edda was translated into English

<p id="d0e968">To the works on Northern mythology mentioned below in the note on the Baldr theories, must be added Dr. Rydberg's <i>Teutonic Mythology</i> (English version by R.B. Anderson, London, 1889), which devotes special attention to Saxo.

<p id="d0e984">The chief apologists for the British theory are Professor Bugge (<i>Studien &uuml;ber die Entstehung der nordischen G&ouml;tter- und Heldensagen</i>, M&uuml;nchen, 1889), and the editors of the <i>Corpus Poeticum Boreale</i> (see the Introduction to that  work, and also the Prolegomena prefixed to their edition of the <i>Sturlunga Saga</i>, Oxford). The case for Norway and Greenland is argued by Dr. Finnur J&oacute;nsson (<i>Den oldnorsk og oldislandske Literaturs-Historie,</i> Copenhagen). The cases for both British and Norwegian origin are based chiefly on rather fanciful arguments from supposed
local colour. The theory of the <i>Corpus Poeticum</i> editors that many of the poems were composed in the Scottish isles is discredited by the absence of Gaelic words or traces
of Gaelic legend. Professor Bugge's North of England theory is slightly stronger, being supported by several Old English expressions
in the poems, but these are not enough to prove that they were composed in England, since most Icelanders travelled east at
some time of their lives.

<p id="d0e1126">The word <i>hro&eth;rba&eth;m</i> (which I have given as &#8220;branch of fame&#8221;) would perhaps be more accurately translated &#8220;tree of fame,&#8221; which Gering explains
as a kenning for Baldr. But there are no kennings of the same sort in the poem, and the line would have no meaning. If it
refers to the mistletoe, as most commentators agree, it merely shows that the poet was ignorant of the nature of the plant,
which would be in favour of its antiquity, rather than the reverse.

is of the less value.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
